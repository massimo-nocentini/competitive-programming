    "# Combinatorial Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "The theory described here is given by [Frank Ruskey][fr] and adapted from his [Combinatorial Generation][cg] book. We use the following arguments to implement some Python functions, available [here][libs:gray]. In this introduction we report some concepts and definitions from Ruskey that we believe interesting and necessary for what follows, starting with the meaning of *Combinatorial Generation*:\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Let's look at all the possibilities.* This phrase sums up the outlook of this book. In\n",
    "computer science, mathematics, and in other fields it is often necessary to examine all of\n",
    "a finite number of possibilities in order to solve a problem or gain insight into the solution\n",
    "of a problem. These possibilities often have an underlying combinatorial structure which\n",
    "can be exploited in order to obtain an efficient algorithm for generating some appropriate\n",
    "representation of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "About *complexity*:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Not much attention has been paid to the model of computation in the area of combinatorial\n",
    "generation. For the most part authors use the random access machine model. This is more\n",
    "or less like counting operations in a Pascal program, with the understanding that integers\n",
    "can be arbitrarily large and the assumption that standard arithmetic operations can be\n",
    "done in constant time. For large integers this is an unrealistic assumption. It is generally\n",
    "the case that integers are small in generation algorithms, but that they are large in ranking\n",
    "and unranking algorithms. We will therefore measure ranking and unranking algorithms in\n",
    "terms of the number of arithmetic operations used.\n",
    "\n",
    "About *analysis*:\n",
    "\n",
    ">There are two terms that are used throughout the book. We strive to develop algorithms\n",
    "that have these properties. \n",
    "   - **CAT** algorithms: the holy grail of generating combinatorial objects is to find an algorithm\n",
    "   that runs in Constant Amortized Time. This means that the amount of computation, after\n",
    "   a small amount of preprocessing, is proportional to the number of objects that are listed.\n",
    "   *We do not count the time to actually output or process the objects; we are only concerned\n",
    "   with the amount of data structure change that occurs as the objects are being generated*. \n",
    "   Suppose that the input to our generation algorithm is n, and that this will produce $N$\n",
    "   objects, each of \"size\" $n$. A CAT algorithm has running time $\\mathcal{O}(N)$. In the typical \n",
    "   application of combinatorial generation, each object, as it is produced, is processed somehow.\n",
    "   If this processing takes time $\\mathcal{O}(n)$, then having a CAT algorithm has no advantage over\n",
    "   having one with running time $\\mathcal{O}(nN)$, since the total running time is $\\mathcal{O}(nN)$ \n",
    "   in either case.\n",
    "   - **BEST** algorithms: this means *Backtracking Ensuring Success at Terminals*. In other\n",
    "   words, the algorithm is of the backtracking type, but every leaf of the backtracking tree is\n",
    "   an object of the desired type; it is a *success*.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Don't count the output* principle:\n",
    "\n",
    ">There are are many papers about generating combinatorial objects that describe an\n",
    "$\\mathcal{O}(nN)$ running time as *optimal*, because this is the amount of output produced by the\n",
    "algorithm — each object has size $n$ and there are $N$ objects in total. This is a misguided\n",
    "notion that has its roots in the way lower bounds are discussed in the traditional introduction\n",
    "to complexity theory course. There the *trivial lower bound* says that the amount of output\n",
    "gives a lower bound on the amount of computation — of course it says the same thing in\n",
    "our setting, *but the amount of output is the wrong thing to measure*.\n",
    ">>**Don't Count the Output Principle**: In combinatorial generation it is the\n",
    "amount of data structure change that should be measured in determining the complexity \n",
    "of an algorithm; the time required to output (and process) each object should be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The *trivial lower bound* for combinatorial generation is $\\mathcal{Θ}(N )$; it is independent of $n$.\n",
    "Now back to our typical application,\n",
    "where processing each object took time $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ even though our generation algorithm was\n",
    "CAT. Wouldn't it be nice if the $\\mathcal{O}(nN)$ could be brought down to $\\mathcal{O}(N)$? \n",
    "This is frequently possible! If you go back and observe how successive objects are processed, *it is often the\n",
    "case that the amount of processing required is proportional to the amount of change that\n",
    "successive objects undergo.*\n",
    "\n",
    "A last concept, *ordering*:\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Lexicographic* order is based on the familiar idea as the ordering of words in dictionaries.\n",
    "The only requirement is that *the letters that make up the alphabet of the language be\n",
    "ordered*. In the definitions below we use $\\prec$ to denote the assumed underlying ordering of\n",
    "the symbols of the alphabet and $<$ to denote orderings of strings (and, of course, integers). \n",
    "We remark again that in most instances the alphabet is the set of natural numbers under the usual numeric ordering\n",
    "$0 \\prec 1 \\prec 2 \\prec \\ldots$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We report definitions of three orderings:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - *lexicographic* (or *lex*) order, denoted by $<_{l}$: \n",
    "   $a_1 a_2 \\ldots a_n <_l b_1 b_2 \\ldots b_m$ if either\n",
    "      1. for some $k$, $a_k \\prec b_k$ and $a_i = b_i$ for $i\\in\\lbrace 1, 2, \\ldots , k − 1\\rbrace$, or\n",
    "      2. $n < m$ and $a_i = b_i$ for $i \\in\\lbrace 1, 2, \\ldots , n\\rbrace$.\n",
    "   - *reverse lexicographic* (or *relex*) order, denoted by $<_{r}$: $a_1 a_2 \\ldots a_n <_r b_1 b_2 \\ldots b_m$\n",
    "   if $b_1 b_2 \\ldots b_m <_l a_1 a_2 \\ldots a_n$ in lex order.\n",
