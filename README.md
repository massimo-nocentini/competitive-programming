# Competitive Programming

In this repo I put my programming training, mostly based on the [CP book][cpbook], against 
[UVa judge][UVa:judge]; moreover, an [index][index] is provided.

## Python libs

My plan is to use Python as the primary language to solve problems; for this reason,
the [`python-libs`][python:libs] directory contains useful definitions to ease solving, 
such as [input utils][libs:input], [sorting and ordering][libs:sorting], 
[behavior][libs:behavior], [bit manipulation][libs:bit:manipulation],
[timing][libs:timing], [gray codes][libs:gray:codes].

## Tutorials

At the same time, I help myself by taking notes about programming techniques, collecting
them in Jupyter notebooks:

   - [bit masking][bm]
   - [gray codes][gray]
   - [backtracking][backtrack]
