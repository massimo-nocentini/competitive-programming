    '''
    Split `line` argument producing an iterable of mapped elements, in the sense of `ctors`.

    Keyword argument `splitter` splits the given `line` respect `space` (' ')
    character; however, it is possible to provide the desired behavior providing
    a custom lambda expression of one parameter, eventually instantiated with `line`.
    The iterable produced by `splitter` should match argument `ctors` in length;
    if this holds, an iterable of mapped elements is produced, composed of elements
    built by application of each function in `ctors` to element in the split, pairwise.
    On the other hand, mapping happens according to the rules of `zip` if lengths differ.

    Keyword argument `do` is an higher order operator, defaults to `None`: if
    given, it should be a function that receive the generator, which is returned, otherwise.

    Moreover, the returned iterable object is a generator, so a linear scan of the line
    *is not* performed, hence there is no need to consume an higher order operator to
    be applied during the scan, this provide good performances at the same time.

    Produces a way to fetch lines by a source.

    Keyword argument `getter` should be a thunk that produces an iterable, call it `i`;
    by default, it produces the iterator which reads from standard input.

    Keyword argument `raw_iter` is a boolean. If it is `True`, that iterator `i` is 
    returned as it is; otherwise, a thunk is returned which wraps the application `next(i)`.
